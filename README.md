Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript

This repository explores different approaches to handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript: 
callbacks, promises, and async/await.


Callbacks

Demonstrates the use of callbacks to handle asynchronous tasks. Includes examples of using callbacks with timers (setTimeout, setInterval) and handling asynchronous operations like file I/O or network requests.


Promises

Introduces the concept of promises and how to create, consume, and chain them. Covers promise creation, resolution, rejection, chaining with .then() and .catch(), and using Promise.all and Promise.race.


Async/Await

Explores the syntax and usage of async/await for handling asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner. Includes examples of using async/await with promises, error handling with try-catch blocks, and potential performance comparisons with promises.
